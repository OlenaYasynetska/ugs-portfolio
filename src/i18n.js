        ukrainian_independence_day_description: '📌 Background\n\nIn August 1991, the GKChP (coup attempt) occurred in Moscow, when part of the USSR leadership tried to restore strict control.\n\nThe coup attempt failed, and in the USSR republics, sentiments for independence sharply intensified.\n\nIn Kyiv on August 22, blue-yellow flags were already being raised en masse — first on buildings, then above the Verkhovna Rada.\n\n📌 August 24, 1991\n\nThe Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR convened an emergency session.\n\nDeputies discussed the situation and the threat of dictatorship returning from Moscow.\n\nThere was a tense but solemn atmosphere in the hall: they understood that the fate of the country was being decided.\n\nAs a result:\n\n346 out of 450 deputies voted "for" (this is an overwhelming majority).\n\nThe Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine was adopted.\n\n📌 What this document meant\n\nUkraine declared itself an independent democratic state.\n\nThe supremacy of Ukrainian laws throughout the territory was affirmed.\n\nIt was established that all state bodies are subordinate only to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.\n\n📌 Why exactly August 24\n\nThis was a consequence of the GKChP failure (August 19-21).\n\nPopular pressure was enormous: thousands of people came out under the parliament.\n\nThe deputies understood that missing the moment meant remaining in the USSR, where everything could return to square one.\n\n📌 After this\n\nAugust 24 was proclaimed Ukrainian Independence Day.\n\nAnd to consolidate the decision, a referendum was scheduled for December 1, 1991, where the people had to confirm or refute this act.\n\nIn the referendum, 90.32% of citizens voted "for" independence.\n\n⚡ Thus, it was on August 24, 1991, that Ukraine legally declared its independence, and on December 1, the people confirmed it.',

The main concerts will take place at Wiener Stadthalle — a 16,000-seat arena that has already hosted Eurovision in 2015.\n\nThe city mayor confirmed that Vienna will allocate 22.6 million euros for the organization, despite the current austerity program. For comparison: Liverpool spent 16 million €, Malmö — 18 million €, Turin — 30 million €, and Basel planned 33.5 million €. The return of the competition to Vienna is explained not only by the symbolism of the anniversary show, but also by the convenience of the city — modern airports, railway connections and a large selection of hotels make it an ideal place for fans from all over Europe.',

        molotov_ribbentrop_text_full: '86 years ago, on August 23, 1939, the Non-Aggression Pact between Germany and the USSR, the so-called "Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact", and secret protocols to it were signed in Moscow, according to which Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Europe.\n\nThis event became the trigger for World War II, which began with a joint attack on Poland by two totalitarian regimes - the Nazi Third Reich from the west and the communist USSR from the east. These military operations were the embodiment of the secret protocols signed in Moscow and ended with a joint military parade of Wehrmacht and Red Army units in Brest on the territory of occupied Poland.\n\nToday, the lessons of the past are more relevant than ever. Just as 86 years ago, Moscow\'s main goal is to divide spheres of influence and forcibly redraw borders in Europe. Just as then, any appeasement of such plans or the conclusion of secret agreements with Moscow can only lead to global catastrophe.\n\nThe events of 1938-1939, culminating in the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the beginning of World War II, demonstrated that appeasing an aggressor does not bring peace; it always leads only to greater war. Then, the consequence of short-sighted policy and cowardice was the death of 70 to 85 million people, unprecedented atrocities and destruction, a global catastrophe for humanity.\n\nThe international community has no right to repeat these mistakes today, when the Russian Federation has unleashed the bloodiest war of aggression in Europe since World War II and has brought back to European soil the unprecedented atrocities of that time, which Russian occupiers are committing during aggression against Ukraine.\n\nIt is telling that the modern regime in Moscow is making every effort to manipulate history and distort the historical truth about August 23, 1939. The signing of the non-aggression pact between the Third Reich and the USSR is justified by various opportunistic arguments, and the fact of a joint attack with the Nazis and the dismemberment of Poland is presented as supposedly strategic necessity. All this contradicts historical documents and testimonies.\n\nWe call on the international community to resolutely condemn Russian manipulations and whitewashing of this and other crimes of the Soviet Union and Stalin\'s regime. It is necessary to double joint efforts to study, preserve and promote the historical truth about the causes and consequences of World War II. Correct conclusions from the past will prevent catastrophic mistakes in the present and future.\n\nIn the context of the current situation, we once again express support for efforts to achieve peace through strength thanks to the leadership of the United States and personally US President Donald Trump, the active role of European allies. We emphasize that Ukraine, like no one else, seeks to end the war and restore comprehensive, just and sustainable peace, is ready for the most effective work with partners to achieve this goal. We separately emphasize the importance of providing effective security guarantees from the United States and European allies for Ukraine in the peace process.\n\nIn light of the lessons of the past, we emphasize that to achieve just peace, it is necessary to increase pressure on the aggressor state Russia and strengthen Ukraine\'s defense capability and resilience. A just end to Russian aggression will be the best evidence that the international community has learned from the mistakes of the 20th century, and that the slogan "Never again!" really has practical meaning for modern generations. The right of might should never become higher than the force of international law, and the desire for peace cannot be a justification for appeasing an aggressor. The events of the past must be a lesson we have learned, not a mistake we have repeated. Together we are capable of protecting the world from this.',

Diese Militäroperationen waren die Verkörperung der in Moskau unterzeichneten Geheimprotokolle und endeten mit einer gemeinsamen Militärparade von Wehrmacht- und Rotarmee-Einheiten in Brest auf dem Territorium des besetzten Polens.\n\nHeute sind die Lehren der Vergangenheit aktueller denn je. Genau wie vor 86 Jahren ist Moskaus Hauptziel die Aufteilung der Einflusssphären und die gewaltsame Neuziehung der Grenzen in Europa. Genau wie damals kann jede Nachgiebigkeit gegenüber solchen Plänen oder der Abschluss geheimer Abkommen mit Moskau nur zu einer globalen Katastrophe führen.\n\nDie Ereignisse von 1938-1939, die in der Unterzeichnung des Molotow-Ribbentrop-Pakts und dem Beginn des Zweiten Weltkriegs gipfelten, zeigten, dass Nachgiebigkeit gegenüber einem Aggressor keinen Frieden bringt; sie führt immer nur zu größerem Krieg. Damals war die Folge kurzsichtiger Politik und Feigheit der Tod von 70 bis 85 Millionen Menschen, beispiellose Gräueltaten und Zerstörung, eine globale Katastrophe für die Menschheit.\n\nDie internationale Gemeinschaft hat kein Recht, diese Fehler heute zu wiederholen, wenn die Russische Föderation den blutigsten Angriffskrieg in Europa seit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg entfesselt hat und die beispiellosen Gräueltaten jener Zeit auf europäischen Boden zurückgebracht hat, die russische Besatzer während der Aggression gegen die Ukraine begehen.\n\nEs ist bezeichnend, dass das moderne Regime in Moskau alle Anstrengungen unternimmt, die Geschichte zu manipulieren und die historische Wahrheit über den 23. August 1939 zu verzerren. Die Unterzeichnung des Nichtangriffspakts zwischen dem Dritten Reich und der UdSSR wird mit verschiedenen opportunistischen Argumenten gerechtfertigt, und die Tatsache eines gemeinsamen Angriffs mit den Nazis und der Zerstückelung Polens wird als angeblich strategische Notwendigkeit dargestellt. All dies widerspricht historischen Dokumenten und Zeugnissen.\n\nWir rufen die internationale Gemeinschaft auf, russische Manipulationen und die Verharmlosung dieses und anderer Verbrechen der Sowjetunion und des Stalin-Regimes entschieden zu verurteilen. Es ist notwendig, gemeinsame Anstrengungen zur Erforschung, Erhaltung und Förderung der historischen Wahrheit über die Ursachen und Folgen des Zweiten Weltkriegs zu verdoppeln. Richtige Schlussfolgerungen aus der Vergangenheit werden katastrophale Fehler in der Gegenwart und Zukunft verhindern.\n\nIm Kontext der aktuellen Situation bekunden wir erneut unsere Unterstützung für Bemühungen, Frieden durch Stärke zu erreichen, dank der Führung der Vereinigten Staaten und persönlich des US-Präsidenten Donald Trump, der aktiven Rolle der europäischen Verbündeten. Wir betonen, dass Україна wie niemand sonst das Ende des Krieges und die Wiederherstellung eines umfassenden, gerechten und nachhaltigen Friedens anstrebt, bereit ist für die effektivste Zusammenarbeit mit Partnern zur Erreichung dieses Ziels. Wir betonen gesondert die Bedeutung der Bereitstellung wirksamer Sicherheitsgarantien der Vereinigten Staaten und europäischen Verbündeten für die Ukraine im Friedensprozess.\n\nIm Licht der Lehren der Vergangenheit betonen wir, dass zur Erreichung eines gerechten Friedens der Druck auf den Aggressorstaat Russland erhöht und die Verteidigungsfähigkeit und Widerstandsfähigkeit der Ukraine gestärkt werden müssen. Ein gerechtes Ende der russischen Aggression wird der beste Beweis dafür sein, dass die internationale Gemeinschaft aus den Fehlern des 20. Jahrhunderts gelernt hat, und dass der Slogan "Nie wieder!" wirklich praktische Bedeutung für moderne Generationen hat. Das Recht der Stärke darf niemals höher werden als die Kraft des Völkerrechts, und der Wunsch nach Frieden kann keine Rechtfertigung für die Beschwichtigung eines Aggressors sein. Die Ereignisse der Vergangenheit müssen eine Lektion sein, die wir gelernt haben, nicht ein Fehler, den wir wiederholt haben. Gemeinsam sind wir in der Lage, die Welt davor zu schützen.',

        molotov_ribbentrop_text: '86 років тому, 23 серпня 1939 року, в Москві була укладена Угода про ненапад між Німеччиною та СРСР, так званий "Пакт Молотова-Ріббентропа", та таємні протоколи до неї, згідно з якими Гітлер і Сталін домовилися розділити Європу.\n\nЦя подія стала спусковим гачком до Другої світової війни, яка почалася зі спільного нападу на Польщу двох тоталітарних режимів - нацитського Третього рейху з заходу та комуністичного СРСР зі сходу. Ці військові операції стали втіленням підписаних у Москві таємних протоколів і завершилися спільним військовим парадом частин Вермахту та Червоної Армії у Бресті на території окупованої Польщі.',

Ці військові операції стали втіленням підписаних у Москві таємних протоколів і завершилися спільним військовим парадом частин Вермахту та Червоної Армії у Бресті на території окупованої Польщі.\n\nСьогодні уроки минулого як ніколи актуальні. Так само як 86 років тому, головною метою Москви є розподіл сфер впливу та силовий переділ кордонів у Європі. Так само як тоді, будь-яке потурання таким планам чи укладення таємних угод з Москвою може призвести лише до глобальної катастрофи.\n\nПодії 1938-1939 років, кульмінацією яких стало підписання пакту Молотова-Ріббентропа та початок Другої світової війни засвідчили, що потурання агресору не приносить мир; воно завжди веде лише до більшої війни. Тоді наслідком недалекоглядної політики та боягузства стали смерті від 70 до 85 мільйонів людей, небачені звірства та руйнування, глобальна катастрофа для людства.\n\nМіжнародна спільнота не має права повторювати ці помилки сьогодні, коли Російська Федерація розв\'язала найбільш криваву загарбницьку війну в Європі з часів Другої світової війни та повернула на європейську землю небачені з того часу звірства, які російські окупанти скоюють в ході агресії проти України.\n\nПоказово, що сучасний режим у Москві докладає усіх зусиль для історичних маніпуляцій і викривлення історичної правди про 23 серпня 1939 року. Підписання пакту про ненапад між Третім Рейхом і СРСР виправдовується всякими опортуністичними аргументами, а факт спільного з нацистами нападу та роздертя Польщі подається нібито як стратегічна необхідність. Все це суперечить історичним документам і свідченням.\n\nЗакликаємо міжнародну спільноту рішуче засудити російські маніпуляції та відбілювання цього та інших злочинів Радянського Союзу та режиму Сталіна. Необхідно подвоїти спільні зусилля з вивчення, збереження та просування історичної правди про причини та наслідки Другої світової війни. Правильні висновки з минулого дозволять запобігти катастрофічним помилкам у теперішньому та майбутньому.\n\nУ контексті сучасної ситуації, вкотре висловлюємо підтримку зусиллям із досягнення миру завдяки силі за лідерства Сполучених Штатів та особисто Президента США Дональда Трампа, активній ролі європейських союзників. Наголошуємо, що Україна як ніхто інший прагне завершення війни та відновлення всеохоплюючого, справедливого та сталого миру, готова до максимально ефективної роботи з партнерами заради досягнення цієї мети. Окремо підкреслюємо важливість надання дієвих гарантій безпеки США та європейських союзників для України в процесі мирного врегулювання.\n\nУ світлі уроків минулого підкреслюємо, що для досягнення справедливого миру необхідне посилення тиску на державу-агресора Росію та зміцнення обороноздатності та стійкості України. Справедливе завершення російської агресії стане найкращим свідченням, що міжнародна спільнота зробила висновки з помилок ХХ століття, а гасло "Ніколи знову!" дійсно має практичне значення для сучасних поколінь. Право сили ніколи не має стати вище за силу міжнародного права, а прагнення миру не може бути виправданням для умиротворення агресора. Події минулого мають бути уроком, який ми вивчили, а не помилкою, яку повторили. Разом ми здатні вберегти світ від цього.',
