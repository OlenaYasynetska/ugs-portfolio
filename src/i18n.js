        molotov_ribbentrop_text_full: '86 years ago, on August 23, 1939, the Non-Aggression Pact between Germany and the USSR, the so-called "Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact", and secret protocols to it were signed in Moscow, according to which Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Europe.\n\nThis event became the trigger for World War II, which began with a joint attack on Poland by two totalitarian regimes - the Nazi Third Reich from the west and the communist USSR from the east. These military operations were the embodiment of the secret protocols signed in Moscow and ended with a joint military parade of Wehrmacht and Red Army units in Brest on the territory of occupied Poland.\n\nToday, the lessons of the past are more relevant than ever. Just as 86 years ago, Moscow\'s main goal is to divide spheres of influence and forcibly redraw borders in Europe. Just as then, any appeasement of such plans or the conclusion of secret agreements with Moscow can only lead to global catastrophe.\n\nThe events of 1938-1939, culminating in the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the beginning of World War II, demonstrated that appeasing an aggressor does not bring peace; it always leads only to greater war. Then, the consequence of short-sighted policy and cowardice was the death of 70 to 85 million people, unprecedented atrocities and destruction, a global catastrophe for humanity.\n\nThe international community has no right to repeat these mistakes today, when the Russian Federation has unleashed the bloodiest war of aggression in Europe since World War II and has brought back to European soil the unprecedented atrocities of that time, which Russian occupiers are committing during aggression against Ukraine.\n\nIt is telling that the modern regime in Moscow is making every effort to manipulate history and distort the historical truth about August 23, 1939. The signing of the non-aggression pact between the Third Reich and the USSR is justified by various opportunistic arguments, and the fact of a joint attack with the Nazis and the dismemberment of Poland is presented as supposedly strategic necessity. All this contradicts historical documents and testimonies.\n\nWe call on the international community to resolutely condemn Russian manipulations and whitewashing of this and other crimes of the Soviet Union and Stalin\'s regime. It is necessary to double joint efforts to study, preserve and promote the historical truth about the causes and consequences of World War II. Correct conclusions from the past will prevent catastrophic mistakes in the present and future.\n\nIn the context of the current situation, we once again express support for efforts to achieve peace through strength thanks to the leadership of the United States and personally US President Donald Trump, the active role of European allies. We emphasize that Ukraine, like no one else, seeks to end the war and restore comprehensive, just and sustainable peace, is ready for the most effective work with partners to achieve this goal. We separately emphasize the importance of providing effective security guarantees from the United States and European allies for Ukraine in the peace process.\n\nIn light of the lessons of the past, we emphasize that to achieve just peace, it is necessary to increase pressure on the aggressor state Russia and strengthen Ukraine\'s defense capability and resilience. A just end to Russian aggression will be the best evidence that the international community has learned from the mistakes of the 20th century, and that the slogan "Never again!" really has practical meaning for modern generations. The right of might should never become higher than the force of international law, and the desire for peace cannot be a justification for appeasing an aggressor. The events of the past must be a lesson we have learned, not a mistake we have repeated. Together we are capable of protecting the world from this.',

Only in 1955 was the State Treaty signed, which restored the country\'s independence.\n\nHowever, one of the key conditions was Austria\'s obligation to maintain permanent neutrality. On October 26, 1955, parliament passed a law establishing this status. Since then, Austria has not joined military blocs and does not host foreign military bases on its territory.\n\n🎉 Why this day is important:\n\n• Symbol of the country\'s independence and freedom.\n• Reminder of the value of peace and neutrality.\n• Day when military parades, cultural events, and tours of government institutions take place throughout Austria.\n\n💡 Interesting fact: although the treaty itself was signed in May 1955, it was October 26 that became the national holiday — after all, that\'s when Austria officially declared to the world: "We are a neutral country."',

August waren schon massenhaft blaue-gelbe Flaggen aufgebaut — zuerst auf Gebäuden, dann über dem Verkhovna Rada.\n\n📌 24. August 1991\n\nDas Verkhovna Rada der Ukrainischen SSR rief eine Notstandsversammlung ab.\n\nAbgeordnete diskutierten die Lage und die Gefahr eines Wiedereintritts aus Moskau.\n\nEs gab eine angespannte, aber ernsthafte Atmosphäre im Saal: sie verstanden, dass die Zukunft des Landes entschieden wurde.\n\nAls Ergebnis:\n\n346 von 450 Abgeordneten votierten "für" (das ist eine Überwältigung).\n\nDas Akt der Unabhängigkeitserklärung der Ukraine wurde angenommen.\n\n📌 Was dieses Dokument bedeutete\n\nUkraine erklärte sich zu einem unabhängigen demokratischen Staat.\n\nDie Suprematie ukrainischer Gesetze wurde bestätigt.\n\nEs wurde festgestellt, dass alle staatlichen Organe nur dem Verkhovna Rada der Ukraine unterstehen.\n\n📌 Warum genau der 24. August\n\nDies war eine Folge des GKChP-Scheiterns (19.-21. August).\n\nDie Belastung der Bevölkerung war riesig: Tausende Menschen kamen unter das Parlament.\n\nDie Abgeordneten verstanden, dass das Fehlen des Augenblicks bedeutete, im Sowjetunion zu bleiben, wo alles wieder auf Anfang zurückkehren konnte.\n\n📌 Nach diesem\n\nAm 24. August wurde der Tag der ukrainischen Unabhängigkeit verkündet.\n\nUnd um die Entscheidung zu verstärken, wurde ein Referendum für den 1. Dezember 1991 angesetzt, bei dem die Bevölkerung die Entscheidung bestätigen oder verweigern musste.\n\nIm Referendum stimmten 90,32% der Bürger für die Unabhängigkeit.\n\n⚡ Somit wurde am 24. August 1991, Ukraine rechtlich seine Unabhängigkeit erklärt, und am 1. Dezember bestätigten die Menschen es.',

Diese Militäroperationen waren die Verkörperung der in Moskau unterzeichneten Geheimprotokolle und endeten mit einer gemeinsamen Militärparade von Wehrmacht- und Rotarmee-Einheiten in Brest auf dem Territorium des besetzten Polens.\n\nHeute sind die Lehren der Vergangenheit aktueller denn je. Genau wie vor 86 Jahren ist Moskaus Hauptziel die Aufteilung der Einflusssphären und die gewaltsame Neuziehung der Grenzen in Europa. Genau wie damals kann jede Nachgiebigkeit gegenüber solchen Plänen oder der Abschluss geheimer Abkommen mit Moskau nur zu einer globalen Katastrophe führen.\n\nDie Ereignisse von 1938-1939, die in der Unterzeichnung des Molotow-Ribbentrop-Pakts und dem Beginn des Zweiten Weltkriegs gipfelten, zeigten, dass Nachgiebigkeit gegenüber einem Aggressor keinen Frieden bringt; sie führt immer nur zu größerem Krieg. Damals war die Folge kurzsichtiger Politik und Feigheit der Tod von 70 bis 85 Millionen Menschen, beispiellose Gräueltaten und Zerstörung, eine globale Katastrophe für die Menschheit.\n\nDie internationale Gemeinschaft hat kein Recht, diese Fehler heute zu wiederholen, wenn die Russische Föderation den blutigsten Angriffskrieg in Europa seit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg entfesselt hat und die beispiellosen Gräueltaten jener Zeit auf europäischen Boden zurückgebracht hat, die russische Besatzer während der Aggression gegen die Ukraine begehen.\n\nEs ist bezeichnend, dass das moderne Regime in Moskau alle Anstrengungen unternimmt, die Geschichte zu manipulieren und die historische Wahrheit über den 23. August 1939 zu verzerren. Die Unterzeichnung des Nichtangriffspakts zwischen dem Dritten Reich und der UdSSR wird mit verschiedenen opportunistischen Argumenten gerechtfertigt, und die Tatsache eines gemeinsamen Angriffs mit den Nazis und der Zerstückelung Polens wird als angeblich strategische Notwendigkeit dargestellt. All dies widerspricht historischen Dokumenten und Zeugnissen.\n\nWir rufen die internationale Gemeinschaft auf, russische Manipulationen und die Verharmlosung dieses und anderer Verbrechen der Sowjetunion und des Stalin-Regimes entschieden zu verurteilen. Es ist notwendig, gemeinsame Anstrengungen zur Erforschung, Erhaltung und Förderung der historischen Wahrheit über die Ursachen und Folgen des Zweiten Weltkriegs zu verdoppeln. Richtige Schlussfolgerungen aus der Vergangenheit werden katastrophale Fehler in der Gegenwart und Zukunft verhindern.\n\nIm Kontext der aktuellen Situation bekunden wir erneut unsere Unterstützung für Bemühungen, Frieden durch Stärke zu erreichen, dank der Führung der Vereinigten Staaten und persönlich des US-Präsidenten Donald Trump, der aktiven Rolle der europäischen Verbündeten. Wir betonen, dass Ukraine, wie niemand anders, das Ende des Krieges und die Wiederherstellung eines umfassenden, gerechten та сталого миру, готова до максимально ефективної роботи з партнерами заради досягнення цієї мети. Окремо підкреслюємо важливість надання дієвих гарантій безпеки США та європейських союзників для України в процесі мирного врегулювання.\n\nУ світлі уроків минулого підкреслюємо, що для досягнення справедливого миру необхідне посилення тиску на державу-агресора Росію та зміцнення обороноздатності та стійкості України. Справедливе завершення російської агресії стане найкращим свідченням, що міжнародна спільнота зробила висновки з помилок ХХ століття, а гасло "Ніколи знову!" дійсно має практичне значення для сучасних поколінь. Право сили ніколи не має стати вище за силу міжнародного права, а прагнення миру не може бути виправданням для умиротворення агресора. Події минулого мають бути уроком, який ми вивчили, а не помилкою, яку повторили. Разом ми здатні вберегти світ від цього.',

Erst 1955 wurde der Staatsvertrag unterzeichnet, der die Unabhängigkeit des Landes wiederherstellte.\n\nEine der Schlüsselbedingungen war jedoch die Verpflichtung Österreichs, dauerhafte Neutralität zu wahren. Am 26. Oktober 1955 verabschiedete das Parlament ein Gesetz, das diesen Status festlegte. Seitdem ist Österreich keinem Militärbündnis beigetreten und beherbergt keine ausländischen Militärstützpunkte auf seinem Territorium.\n\n🎉 Warum dieser Tag wichtig ist:\n\n• Symbol der Unabhängigkeit und Freiheit des Landes.\n• Erinnerung an den Wert von Frieden und Neutralität.\n• Tag, an dem in ganz Österreich Militärparaden, kulturelle Veranstaltungen und Führungen durch Regierungsinstitutionen stattfinden.\n\n💡 Interessante Tatsache: Obwohl der Vertrag selbst im Mai 1955 unterzeichnet wurde, wurde der 26.

        austria_national_day_description: 'Сьогодні Австрія відзначає один з найважливіших державних свят — Національний день.\n\n📖 Трохи історії:\nПісля закінчення Другої світової війни Австрія перебувала під окупацією союзних держав (СРСР, США, Великобританії та Франції). Лише в 1955 році було підписано Державний договір, який відновив незалежність країни.\n\nОднак однією з ключових умов стало зобов\'язання Австрії зберігати постійний нейтралітет. 26 жовтня 1955 року парламент прийняв закон, який закріпив цей статус. З тих пір Австрія не вступає до військових блоків і не розміщує на своїй території іноземні військові бази.\n\n🎉 Чому цей день важливий:\n\n• Символ незалежності та свободи країни.\n• Нагадування про цінність миру та нейтралітету.\n• День, коли по всій Австрії проходять військові паради, культурні заходи, екскурсії до державних установ.\n\n💡 Цікавий факт: хоча сам договір було підписано в травні 1955 року, саме 26 жовтня стало днем національного свята — адже саме тоді Австрія офіційно заявила світу: «Ми — нейтральна країна».',

Ці військові операції стали втіленням підписаних у Москві таємних протоколів і завершилися спільним військовим парадом частин Вермахту та Червоної Армії у Бресті на території окупованої Польщі.\n\nСьогодні уроки минулого як ніколи актуальні. Так само як 86 років тому, головною метою Москви є розподіл сфер впливу та силовий переділ кордонів у Європі. Так само як тоді, будь-яке потурання таким планам чи укладення таємних угод з Москвою може призвести лише до глобальної катастрофи.\n\nПодії 1938-1939 років, кульмінацією яких стало підписання пакту Молотова-Ріббентропа та початок Другої світової війни засвідчили, що потурання агресору не приносить мир; воно завжди веде лише до більшої війни. Тоді наслідком недалекоглядної політики та боягузства стали смерті від 70 до 85 мільйонів людей, небачені звірства та руйнування, глобальна катастрофа для людства.\n\nМіжнародна спільнота не має права повторювати ці помилки сьогодні, коли Російська Федерація розв\'язала найбільш криваву загарбницьку війну в Європі з часів Другої світової війни та повернула на європейську землю небачені з того часу звірства, які російські окупанти скоюють в ході агресії проти України.\n\nПоказово, що сучасний режим у Москві докладає усіх зусиль для історичних маніпуляцій і викривлення історичної правди про 23 серпня 1939 року. Підписання пакту про ненапад між Третім Рейхом і СРСР виправдовується всякими опортуністичними аргументами, а факт спільного з нацистами нападу та роздертя Польщі подається нібито як стратегічна необхідність. Все це суперечить історичним документам і свідченням.\n\nЗакликаємо міжнародну спільноту рішуче засудити російські маніпуляції та відбілювання цього та інших злочинів Радянського Союзу та режиму Сталіна. Необхідно подвоїти спільні зусилля з вивчення, збереження та просування історичної правди про причини та наслідки Другої світової війни. Правильні висновки з минулого дозволять запобігти катастрофічним помилкам у теперішньому та майбутньому.\n\nУ контексті сучасної ситуації, вкотре висловлюємо підтримку зусиллям із досягнення миру завдяки силі за лідерства Сполучених Штатів та особисто Президента США Дональда Трампа, активній ролі європейських союзників. Наголошуємо, що Україна як ніхто інший прагне завершення війни та відновлення всеохоплюючого, справедливого та сталого миру, готова до максимально ефективної роботи з партнерами заради досягнення цієї мети. Окремо підкреслюємо важливість надання дієвих гарантій безпеки США та європейських союзників для України в процесі мирного врегулювання.\n\nУ світлі уроків минулого підкреслюємо, що для досягнення справедливого миру необхідне посилення тиску на державу-агресора Росію та зміцнення обороноздатності та стійкості України. Справедливе завершення російської агресії стане найкращим свідченням, що міжнародна спільнота зробила висновки з помилок ХХ століття, а гасло "Ніколи знову!" дійсно має практичне значення для сучасних поколінь. Право сили ніколи не має стати вище за силу міжнародного права, а прагнення миру не може бути виправданням для умиротворення агресора. Події минулого мають бути уроком, який ми вивчили, а не помилкою, яку повторили. Разом ми здатні вберегти світ від цього.',

Лише в 1955 році було підписано Державний договір, який відновив незалежність країни.\n\nОднак однією з ключових умов стало зобов\'язання Австрії зберігати постійний нейтралітет. 26 жовтня 1955 року парламент прийняв закон, який закріпив цей статус. З тих пір Австрія не вступає до військових блоків і не розміщує на своїй території іноземні військові бази.\n\n🎉 Чому цей день важливий:\n\n• Символ незалежності та свободи країни.\n• Нагадування про цінність миру та нейтралітету.\n• День, коли по всій Австрії проходять військові паради, культурні заходи, екскурсії до державних установ.\n\n💡 Цікавий факт: хоча сам договір було підписано в травні 1955 року, саме 26 жовтня стало днем національного свята — адже саме тоді Австрія офіційно заявила світу: «Ми — нейтральна країна».',
